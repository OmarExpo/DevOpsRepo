SPRING BOOT - GITHUB - HEROKU
DevOps CI-CD PIPELINE

This is project based on Spring Boot versioned in GitHub and at the end deployed to Heroku.
If you are interested and want to implement it yourself, first just click on my GitHub repository link and clone it. Although it is easy task, in case you don’t know how to clone a project from GitHub you are better off google it as you will see plenty of tutorials with step-by-step instruction on how to.
Now, assuming you cloned it, whether through command line or directly in the GUI.
Through command line (best and quicker option though):
  _ create a directory for your new project
  _ navigate to it by cd-into, type: 
      git clone <paste-here-repo-URL>        (enter hit enter)
      cd <project-name>
  _ Initialize it:
      git init                    
      git add .       (Add your local files to the project git repo. This stage them for the first       commit)
      git commit -m “First commit”   (this commits for changes & prepare them to be pushed)
